    As soon as winter approaches, the situation for many people escalates
    dangerously, especially for those who are already vulnerable due to
    displacement and poverty: they suffer from hunger and have little physical
    strength to counter the bitter cold. As part of our winter aid, WHH supplies
    families who are particularly hard hit by the frost and the current rise in
    prices for staple foods and petrol. For example, vouchers for food, warm
    clothing and fuel are distributed.

    We greatly appreciate your desire to support refugees with warm winter
    clothing or food donations. However, we ask that you refrain from making
    donations in kind for one important reason: WHH has made it a guiding
    principle to purchase relief goods, such as clothing or food, for its aid
    projects in the respective countries or regions in which we are active. This
    is not only more cost-effective but also involves the local economy and
    takes into account local traditions and cultural conditions.

    Care is made up of large and small nonprofits from 64 districts. When
    disasters and crises strike, we are committed to connecting donors to vetted
    organizations responding to needs in the impacted communities from the
    initial emergency relief phase through the mid- and longer-term recovery. We
    often support international or regional first responders in the initial
    stages of relief. However, we believe local, community-led organizations are
    best positioned to assess and respond to needs in the medium- and long-term.
    We listen carefully to what these local leaders deem most critical. Our view
    is that community-led organizations possess critical knowledge about their
    communities and can nimbly and effectively navigate unique dynamics in their
    region. Getting funds to them benefits communities directly, quickly, and
    with longer-term impact.
