    All donations to WC Project funds will support immediate relief and
    long-term recovery efforts in the region(s) affected by the specifically
    described disaster or crisis. Typically, money is first sent to help meet
    the most urgent and immediate needs, including the provision of shelter,
    medical care, food, and clean water. Once initial relief work is complete,
    money from a fund will be allocated by WC-Project for longer-term recovery
    effortsâ€”largely led by local representative.

    WC-Project is made up of large and small nonprofits from 64 districts. When
    disasters and crises strike, we are committed to connecting donors to vetted
    organizations responding to needs in the impacted communities from the
    initial emergency relief phase through the mid- and longer-term recovery. We
    often support international or regional first responders in the initial
    stages of relief. However, we believe local, community-led organizations are
    best positioned to assess and respond to needs in the medium- and long-term.
    We listen carefully to what these local leaders deem most critical. Our view
    is that community-led organizations possess critical knowledge about their
    communities and can nimbly and effectively navigate unique dynamics in their
    region. Getting funds to them benefits communities directly, quickly, and
    with longer-term impact.
